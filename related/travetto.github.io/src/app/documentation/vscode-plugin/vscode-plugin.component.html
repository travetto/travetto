<h1>VS Code Plugin
          
        </h1>

The <a target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcsine.travetto-plugin">VSCode plugin</a> directly integrates with <a target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://travetto.dev">travetto</a> framework, exposing some of the <a class="module-link" href="/docs/cli" title="CLI infrastructure for travetto framework">Command Line Interface</a> functionality.

The currently supported features are:
<ul> <li>Real-time test evaluation and debugging</li>
 <li>Application launching with parameters</li>
 <li>Miscellaneous utilities</li></ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>

The test related functionality relies upon the <a class="module-link" href="/docs/test" title="Declarative test framework that provides hooks for high levels of integration with the travetto framework and test plugin">Testing</a> module being installed, and used to define tests (<a target="_blank" class="source-link" href="/docs/test/src/decorator/suite.ts#L12">@Suite</a> and <a target="_blank" class="source-link" href="/docs/test/src/decorator/test.ts#L9">@Test</a>).

<h3>Real-time Test Evaluation</h3>

The real-time test functionality will re-evaluate your test code on save.  This means as you type and save, the test will run.  The test will provide feedback inline, using green to indicate success, red to indicate failure, and gray to indicate unknown.

<h3>Debugging Tests</h3>

While working on a test, if you want to debug it, you can press running <code class="item input">command-shift-t</code> on OSX or <code class="item input">ctrl-shift-t</code> on Windows/Linux.  This will start a debug session with the current line activated as a breakpoint.  This allows you to seamlessly jump into a debug session while writing tests.

In addition to manual invocation at a line, each test has a <a target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/programmatic-language-features#codelens-show-actionable-context-information-within-source-code">CodeLens</a>, that allows for trigger the test as well.

<h3>Commands</h3>

<ul> <li><code class="item input">Travetto: Debug Tests</code> to force a running all the tests in debug mode.  Will not establish a breakpoint, but will use any existing breakpoints.</li>
 <li><code class="item input">Travetto: Re-run Tests</code> to force a full re-run of all the tests in a given document</li></ul>

<h2>Application Launching</h2>

While using the <a class="module-link" href="/docs/app" title="Application registration/management and run support.">Application</a>, a common pattern is to use <a target="_blank" class="source-link" href="/docs/app/src/decorator.ts#L24">@Application</a> annotations to define entry points into the application.  These entry points can take parameters, and if using the cli, you can invoke them with parameters, type checked and validated.

The plugin exposes this functionality as a command, to allow you to debug these applications directly from the editor.

<h3>Running</h3>

<img src="/home/tim/Code/travetto/related/vscode-plugin/images/run-workflow.gif" alt"Run Workflow">

Launching relies upon the command <code class="item input">Travetto: Run New Application</code>.  This will show you a list of the available entry points in the application, with the parameters they support.  Selecting an application will take you through the parameter flow to select inputs, and once all parameters are selected, your application will launch.

After running and selecting a configuration for an application, you can now access those configurations via <code class="item input">Travetto: Run Recent Application</code>.  This allows you to execute a recent run that you can invoke immediately without prompting for inputs. If you find yourself running the same application multiple times, you can also invoke <code class="item input">Travetto: Run Most Recent Application</code> to bypass application selection overall.

<h3>Exporting and Customizing</h3>

<img src="/home/tim/Code/travetto/related/vscode-plugin/images/run-export-workflow.gif" alt"Export Workflow">

If at any point in time, you wish to modify the launch configuration of any application, you can execute the command <code class="item input">Travetto: Export Application Launch</code>, and it will provide the same options as launch.  The only difference is that instead of running the application when it's done, you will have a new launch config in your debug launch configs.  This option is now completely independent from the plugin and can be modified without issue.

<h3>Commands</h3>

<ul> <li><code class="item input">Travetto: Run New Application</code> to launch a new application config</li>
 <li><code class="item input">Travetto: Run Recent Application</code> to launch a previously configured application</li>
 <li><code class="item input">Travetto: Run Most Recent Application</code> to launch the most recently run configured application</li>
 <li><code class="item input">Travetto: Export Application Launch</code> to export an application config</li></ul>

<h2>Misc Utilities</h2>

Currently the supported commands are:
<ul> <li><code class="item input">Travetto: Clean</code> to run the cli operation <code class="item input">travetto clean</code>.  This will purge the project's cache, which is generally after workspace changes, like npm installs.</li></ul>
