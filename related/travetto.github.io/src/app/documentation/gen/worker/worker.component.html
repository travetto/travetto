This module provides the necessary primitives for handling dependent workers.  A worker can be an individual actor or could be a pool of workers. Node provides ipc (inter-process communication) functionality out of the box. This module builds upon that by providing enhanced event management, richer process management, as well as constructs for orchestrating a conversation between two processes.
<h2 id="execution-pools">Execution Pools</h2>

With respect to managing multiple executions, <a target="_blank" class="source-link" href="https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/worker/src/pool.ts#L32">WorkPool</a> is provided to allow for concurrent operation, and processing of jobs concurrently.  To manage the flow of jobs, <a target="_blank" class="source-link" href="https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/runtime/src/queue.ts#L6">AsyncQueue</a> is used to support a wide range of use cases. <a target="_blank" class="source-link" href="https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/runtime/src/queue.ts#L6">AsyncQueue</a> allows for manual control of iteration, which is useful for event driven work loads. <br><br>

<h2 id="ipc-support">IPC Support</h2>

Within the <code class="item input">comm</code> package, there is support for two primary communication elements: <a target="_blank" class="source-link" href="https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/worker/src/ipc/child.ts#L6">ChildCommChannel</a> and <a target="_blank" class="source-link" href="https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/worker/src/ipc/parent.ts#L10">ParentCommChannel</a>.  Usually <a target="_blank" class="source-link" href="https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/worker/src/ipc/parent.ts#L10">ParentCommChannel</a> indicates it is the owner of the sub process. <a target="_blank" class="source-link" href="https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/worker/src/ipc/child.ts#L6">ChildCommChannel</a> indicates that it has been created/spawned/forked by the parent and will communicate back to it's parent. This generally means that a <a target="_blank" class="source-link" href="https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/worker/src/ipc/parent.ts#L10">ParentCommChannel</a> can be destroyed (i.e. killing the subprocess) where a <a target="_blank" class="source-link" href="https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/worker/src/ipc/child.ts#L6">ChildCommChannel</a> can only exit the process, but the channel cannot be destroyed.
