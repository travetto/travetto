This module provides basic support for interacting with the terminal, and provides the basis for output colorization and the basic command line interactions.  The functionality can be broken down into:
<ul> <li>Terminal Interactions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="terminal-interactions">Terminal Interactions</h2>

Within the <a target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://travetto.dev">Travetto</a> framework, there are plenty of command line interactions that are enhanced with additional interactivity.  This mainly revolves around indicating progress while a program is executing.  The module provides support for:
<ul> <li>Progress Bars</li>
<li>Waiting Indicators</li>
<li>Streaming Content</li>
</ul>
This is generally meant for use within the framework, and so is highly tailored to the specific needs and scenarios.  You can see this pattern play out in the <a class="module-link" routerLink="/docs/compiler" title="The compiler infrastructure for the Travetto framework">Compiler</a> progress output, or in <a class="module-link" routerLink="/docs/pack" title="Code packing utilities">Pack</a>'s output. <br><br>
In these scenarios, the dynamic behaviors are dependent on having an interactive TTY.  When running without access to a proper stdin, the output will default to basic line printing.    This dynamic behavior can also be disabled using the environment variable <code class="item field">TRV_QUIET</code>.  When set to <code class="item input">1</code> will provide a minimal text-based experience.
