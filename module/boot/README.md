# Boot
## Bootstrapping and application phase management for travetto applications.

**Install: @travetto/boot**
```bash
npm install @travetto/boot
```

Boot is basic environment  awareness coupled with typescript bootstrapping for [Travetto](https://travetto.dev) apps and libraries.  It has support for the following key areas:
   
   *  Module Indexing
   *  Main Entry Bootstrapping
   *  Console Management
   *  Shutdown Management

### Module Indexing
The bootstrap process will also produce an index of all source files, which allows for fast in-memory scanning.  This allows for all the automatic discovery that is used within the framework.

## Shutdown Management

Another key lifecycle is the process of shutting down. The framework provides centralized functionality for running operations on shutdown. Primarily used by the framework for cleanup operations, this provides a clean interface for registering shutdown handlers. The code overrides `process.exit` to properly handle `SIGKILL` and `SIGINT`, with a default threshold of 3 seconds. In the advent of a `SIGTERM` signal, the code exits immediately without any cleanup.

As a registered shutdown handler, you can do.

**Code: Registering a shutdown handler**
```typescript
import { ShutdownManager } from '@travetto/boot';

export function registerShutdownHandler() {
  ShutdownManager.onShutdown('handler-name', async () => {
    // Do important work, the framework will wait until all async
    //   operations are completed before finishing shutdown
  });
}
```
