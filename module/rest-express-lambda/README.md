# Express REST AWS Lambda Source
## Express AWS Lambda provider for the travetto rest module.

**Install: @travetto/rest-express-lambda**
```bash
npm install @travetto/rest-express-lambda
```

The [express](https://expressjs.com) module supports AWS lambda integration when installed.  This produces an instance of [RestApplication](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/rest/src/application/rest.ts#L23) that is able to integrate with AWS appropriately.
