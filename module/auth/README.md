# Authentication
## Authentication scaffolding for the travetto framework

**Install: @travetto/auth**
```bash
npm install @travetto/auth
```

This module provides the high-level backdrop for managing security principals.  The goal of this module is to be a centralized location for various security frameworks to plug into.  The primary contributions are:

   
   *  Standard Types
   *  Authentication Contract
   *  Authorization Contract
   *  Common security-related utilities for    
      *  Checking permissions
      *  Generating passwords

## Standard Types
The module's goal is to be as flexible as possible.  To that end, the primary contract that this module defines, is that of the [Principal Structure](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/auth/src/types/principal.ts#L8).

**Code: Principal Structure**
```typescript
export interface Principal<D = any> {
  /**
   * Primary identifier for a user
   */
  id: string;
  /**
   * Date of expiration
   */
  expiresAt?: Date;
  /**
   * Date of issuance
   */
  issuedAt?: Date;
  /**
   * Max age in seconds a principal is valid
   */
  maxAge?: number;
  /**
   * The source of the issuance
   */
  issuer?: string;
  /**
   * Supplemental details
   */
  details?: D;
  /**
   * List of all provided permissions
   */
  permissions?: string[];
}
```

As referenced above, a [Principal Structure](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/auth/src/types/principal.ts#L8) is defined as a user with respect to a security context. This can be information the application knows about the user (authorized) or what a separate service may know about a user (3rd-party authenticatino).

## Authentication

**Code: Authenticator**
```typescript
export interface Authenticator<T = unknown, P extends Principal = Principal, C = unknown> {
  /**
   * Verify the payload, verifying the payload is correctly identified.
   * @returns Valid principal if authenticated
   * @returns undefined if authentication is valid, but incomplete (multi-step)
   * @throws AppError if authentication fails
   */
  authenticate(payload: T, ctx?: C): Promise<P | undefined> | P | undefined;
}
```

The [Authenticator](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/auth/src/types/authenticator.ts#L8) only requires one method to be defined, and that is `authenticate`. This method receives a generic payload, and a supplemental context as an input. The interface is respon for converting that to an authenticated principal.

### Example
The [JWT](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/jwt#readme "JSON Web Token implementation") module is a good example of an authenticator. This is a common use case for simple internal auth.

## Authorization

**Code: Authorizer**
```typescript
export interface Authorizer<P extends Principal = Principal> {
  /**
   * Authorize inbound principal, verifying it's permission to access the system.
   * @param principal
   * @returns New principal that conforms to the required principal shape
   */
  authorize(principal: Principal): Promise<P> | P;
}
```

Authorizers are generally seen as a secondary step post-authentication. Authentication acts as a very basic form of authorization, assuming the principal store is owned by the application.

The [Authorizer](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/auth/src/types/authorizer.ts#L8) only requires one method to be defined, and that is `authorizer`. This method receives an authenticated principal as an input, and is responsible for converting that to an authorized principal.

### Example
The [Data Modeling Support](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/model#readme "Datastore abstraction for core operations.") extension is a good example of an authenticator. This is a common use case for simple internal auth.

Overall, the structure is simple, but drives home the primary use cases of the framework. The goals are:
   
   *  Be able to identify a user uniquely
   *  To have a reference to a user's set of permissions
   *  To have access to the principal

## Common Utilities
The [AuthUtil](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/auth/src/util.ts#L18) provides the following functionality:

**Code: Auth util structure**
```typescript
import * as crypto from 'crypto';
import * as util from 'util';
import { AppError, Util } from '@travetto/base';
const pbkdf2 = util.promisify(crypto.pbkdf2);
type PermSet = Set<string> | ReadonlySet<string>;
type PermissionChecker = {
  all: (perms: PermSet) => boolean;
  any: (perms: PermSet) => boolean;
};
/**
 * Standard auth utilities
 */
export class AuthUtil {
  /**
   * Build a permission checker against the provided permissions
   *
   * @param perms Set of permissions to check
   * @param defaultIfEmpty If no perms passed, default to empty
   */
  /**
   * Build a permission checker off of an include, and exclude set
   *
   * @param include Which permissions to include
   * @param exclude Which permissions to exclude
   * @param matchAll Whether not all permissions should be matched
   */
  static permissionChecker(include: Iterable<string>, exclude: Iterable<string>, mode: 'all' | 'any' = 'any') ;
  /**
   * Build a permission checker off of an include, and exclude set
   *
   * @param include Which permissions to include
   * @param exclude Which permissions to exclude
   * @param matchAll Whether not all permissions should be matched
   */
  static checkPermissions(permissions: Iterable<string>, include: Iterable<string>, exclude: Iterable<string>, mode: 'all' | 'any' = 'any') ;
  /**
   * Generate a hash for a given value
   *
   * @param value Value to hash
   * @param salt The salt value
   * @param iterations Number of iterations on hashing
   * @param keylen Length of hash
   * @param digest Digest method
   */
  static generateHash(value: string, salt: string, iterations = 25000, keylen = 256, digest = 'sha256') ;
  /**
   * Generate a salted password, with the ability to validate the password
   *
   * @param password
   * @param salt Salt value, or if a number, length of salt
   * @param validator Optional function to validate your password
   */
  static async generatePassword(password: string, salt: number | string = 32) ;
}
```

`permissionSetChecker` is probably the only functionality that needs to be explained.The function operates in a `DENY` / `ALLOW` mode.  This means that a permission check will succeed only if:

   
   *  The user is logged in     
      *  If `matchAll` is false:    
         *  The user does not have any permissions in the exclusion list
         *  The include list is empty, or the user has at least one permission in the include list.
      *  Else    
         *  The user does not have all permissions in the exclusion list
         *  The include list is empty, or the user has all permissions in the include list. 

## Extension - Model

This module also supports the integration between the [Authentication](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/auth#readme "Authentication scaffolding for the travetto framework") module and the [Data Modeling Support](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/model#readme "Datastore abstraction for core operations."). 

The asset module requires an [CRUD](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/model/src/service/crud.ts#L11) to provide functionality for reading and storing user information. You can use any existing providers to serve as your [CRUD](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/model/src/service/crud.ts#L11), or you can roll your own.

**Install: provider**
```bash
npm install @travetto/model-{provider}
```

Currently, the following are packages that provide [CRUD](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/model/src/service/crud.ts#L11):
   
   *  [DynamoDB Model Support](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/model-dynamodb#readme "DynamoDB backing for the travetto model module.") - @travetto/model-dynamodb
   *  [Elasticsearch Model Source](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/model-elasticsearch#readme "Elasticsearch backing for the travetto model module, with real-time modeling support for Elasticsearch mappings.") @travetto/model-elasticsearch
   *  [Firestore Model Support](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/model-firestore#readme "Firestore backing for the travetto model module.") @travetto/model-firestore
   *  [MongoDB Model Support](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/model-mongo#readme "Mongo backing for the travetto model module.") @travetto/model-mongo
   *  [Redis Model Support](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/model-redis#readme "Redis backing for the travetto model module.") @travetto/model-redis
   *  [S3 Model Support](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/model-s3#readme "S3 backing for the travetto model module.") @travetto/model-s3
   *  [SQL Model Service](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/model-sql#readme "SQL backing for the travetto model module, with real-time modeling support for SQL schemas.") @travetto/model-sql

The module itself is fairly straightforward, and truly the only integration point for this module to work is defined at the model level.  The contract for authentication is established in code as providing translation to and from a [Registered Principal](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/auth/src/extension/model.ts#L16)

A registered principal extends the base concept of an principal, by adding in additional fields needed for local registration, specifically password management information.

**Code: Registered Principal**
```typescript
export interface RegisteredPrincipal extends Principal {
  /**
   * Password hash
   */
  hash?: string;
  /**
   * Password salt
   */
  salt?: string;
  /**
   * Temporary Reset Token
   */
  resetToken?: string;
  /**
   * End date for the reset token
   */
  resetExpires?: Date;
  /**
   * The actual password, only used on password set/update
   */
  password?: string;
}
```

**Code: A valid user model**
```typescript
import { Model, BaseModel } from '@travetto/model';
import { RegisteredPrincipal } from '@travetto/auth';

@Model()
export class User extends BaseModel implements RegisteredPrincipal {
  source: string;
  details: Record<string, unknown>;
  password?: string;
  salt: string;
  hash: string;
  resetToken?: string;
  resetExpires?: Date;
  permissions: string[];
}
```

## Configuration

Additionally, there exists a common practice of mapping various external security principals into a local contract. These external identities, as provided from countless authentication schemes, need to be homogeonized for use.  This has been handled in other frameworks by using external configuration, and creating a mapping between the two set of fields.  Within this module, the mappings are defined as functions in which you can translate to the model from an identity or to an identity from a model.

**Code: Principal Source configuration**
```typescript
import { InjectableFactory } from '@travetto/di';
import { ModelAuthService, RegisteredPrincipal } from '@travetto/auth';
import { ModelCrudSupport } from '@travetto/model';

import { User } from './model';

class AuthConfig {
  @InjectableFactory()
  static getModelAuthService(svc: ModelCrudSupport) {
    return new ModelAuthService(
      svc,
      User,
      (u: User) => ({    // This converts User to a RegisteredPrincipal
        source: 'model',
        provider: 'model',
        id: u.id,
        permissions: u.permissions,
        hash: u.hash,
        salt: u.salt,
        resetToken: u.resetToken,
        resetExpires: u.resetExpires,
        password: u.password,
        details: u,
      }),
      (u: Partial<RegisteredPrincipal>) => User.from(({   // This converts a RegisteredPrincipal to a User
        id: u.id,
        permissions: [...(u.permissions || [])],
        hash: u.hash,
        salt: u.salt,
        resetToken: u.resetToken,
        resetExpires: u.resetExpires,
      })
      )
    );
  }
}
```

**Code: Sample usage**
```typescript
import { AppError } from '@travetto/base';
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@travetto/di';
import { ModelAuthService } from '@travetto/auth';

import { User } from './model';

@Injectable()
class UserService {

  @Inject()
  private auth: ModelAuthService<User>;

  async authenticate(identity: User) {
    try {
      return await this.auth.authenticate(identity);
    } catch (err) {
      if (err instanceof AppError && err.category === 'notfound') {
        return await this.auth.register(identity);
      } else {
        throw err;
      }
    }
  }
}
```
