This module provides the high-level backdrop for managing security principals.  The goal of this module is to be a centralized location for various security frameworks to plug into.  The primary contributions are:

${d.List(
  'Standard Types',
  d`Authentication Contract`,
  d`Authorization Contract`,
  d`Common security-related utilities for ${d.List(
    'Checking permissions',
    'Generating passwords'
  )}`
)}

${d.Section('Standard Types')}
The module's goal is to be as flexible as possible.  To that end, the primary contract that this module defines, is that of the ${Principal.link}.

${Principal}

As referenced above, a ${Principal.link} is defined as a user with respect to a security context. This can be information the application knows about the user (authorized) or what a separate service may know about a user (3rd-party authentication).

${d.Section('Authentication')}

${Authenticator}

The ${Authenticator.link} only requires one method to be defined, and that is ${d.Method('authenticate')}. This method receives a generic payload, and a supplemental context as an input. The interface is responsible for converting that to an authenticated principal.

${d.SubSection('Example')}
The ${mod.Jwt} module is a good example of an authenticator. This is a common use case for simple internal auth.

${d.Section('Authorization')}

${Authorizer}
Authorizers are generally seen as a secondary step post-authentication. Authentication acts as a very basic form of authorization, assuming the principal store is owned by the application.

The ${Authorizer.link} only requires one method to be defined, and that is ${d.Method('authorizer')}. This method receives an authenticated principal as an input, and is responsible for converting that to an authorized principal.

${d.SubSection('Example')}
The ${mod.Model} extension is a good example of an authenticator. This is a common use case for simple internal auth.

Overall, the structure is simple, but drives home the primary use cases of the framework. The goals are:
${d.List(
  'Be able to identify a user uniquely',
  'To have a reference to a user\'s set of permissions',
  'To have access to the principal',
)}


${d.Section('Common Utilities')}
The ${AuthUtil} provides the following functionality:

${d.Code('Auth util structure', AuthUtil.áš•file, true)}

${d.Method('permissionSetChecker')} is probably the only functionality that needs to be explained.The function operates in a ${d.Input('DENY')} / ${d.Input('ALLOW')} mode.  This means that a permission check will succeed only if:

${d.List(
  d`The user is logged in  ${d.List(
    d`If ${d.Input('matchAll')} is false: ${d.List(
      'The user does not have any permissions in the exclusion list',
      'The include list is empty, or the user has at least one permission in the include list.'
    )}`,
    d`Else ${d.List(
      'The user does not have all permissions in the exclusion list',
      'The include list is empty, or the user has all permissions in the include list.'
    )}`
  )}`
)} 

${d.Section('Extension - Model')}

This module also supports the integration between the ${mod.Auth} module and the ${mod.Model}. 

The asset module requires an ${Links.Crud} to provide functionality for reading and storing user information. You can use any existing providers to serve as your ${Links.Crud}, or you can roll your own.

${d.Install('provider', '@travetto/model-{provider}')}

Currently, the following are packages that provide ${Links.Crud}:
${d.List(
  d`${mod.ModelDynamodb} - @travetto/model-dynamodb`,
  d`${mod.ModelElasticsearch} @travetto/model-elasticsearch`,
  d`${mod.ModelFirestore} @travetto/model-firestore`,
  d`${mod.ModelMongo} @travetto/model-mongo`,
  d`${mod.ModelRedis} @travetto/model-redis`,
  d`${mod.ModelS3} @travetto/model-s3`,
  d`${mod.ModelSql} @travetto/model-sql`,
)}

The module itself is fairly straightforward, and truly the only integration point for this module to work is defined at the model level.  The contract for authentication is established in code as providing translation to and from a ${RegisteredPrincipal.link}

A registered principal extends the base concept of an principal, by adding in additional fields needed for local registration, specifically password management information.

${RegisteredPrincipal}

${d.Code('A valid user model', 'doc/model/model.ts')}

${d.Section('Configuration')}

Additionally, there exists a common practice of mapping various external security principals into a local contract. These external identities, as provided from countless authentication schemes, need to be homogenized for use.  This has been handled in other frameworks by using external configuration, and creating a mapping between the two set of fields.  Within this module, the mappings are defined as functions in which you can translate to the model from an identity or to an identity from a model.

${d.Code('Principal Source configuration', 'doc/model/config.ts')}

${d.Code('Sample usage', 'doc/model/usage.ts')}
