# Watch
## Support for making files watchable during runtime

**Install: @travetto/watch**
```bash
npm install @travetto/watch
```

This module is intended to be used during development, and is not during production.  This constraint is tied to the performance hit the functionality could have at run-time.  To that end, this is primarily an utilitiy for other modules, but it's functionality could prove useful to others during development.

## File Watching

This module  is the base file system watching support for [Travetto](https://travetto.dev) applications.  In addition to file system scanning, the framework offers a simple file watching library.  The goal is to provide a substantially smaller footprint than [gaze](https://github.com/shama/gaze) or [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar).  Utilizing the patterns from the file scanning, you create a [Watcher](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/watch/src/watcher.ts#L21) that either has files added manually, or has patterns added that will recursively look for files. 

**Code: Example of watching for specific files**
```typescript
import { Watcher } from '@travetto/watch';

export function main(): void {
  const watcher = new Watcher('base/path/to/...')
    .on('all', ({ event, entry }) => {
      if (entry.file.endsWith('.config') || entry.file.endsWith('.config.json')) {
        console.log('File Event', { event, file: entry.file });
      }
    });

  setTimeout(() => watcher.close(), 1000);
}
```
