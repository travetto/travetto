# RESTful AWS Lambda
## RESTful APIs entry point support for AWS Lambdas.

**Install: @travetto/rest-aws-lambda**
```bash
npm install @travetto/rest-aws-lambda
```

The module provides support basic support with AWS lambdas. When using one of the specific rest modules (e.g. [Express REST Source](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/rest-express#readme "Express provider for the travetto rest module.")), you can install the appropriate lambda-related dependencies installed (e.g. [aws-serverless-express](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-express/blob/master/README.md)) to enable integration with AWS.  Nothing in the code needs to be modified to support the AWS integration, but there are some limitations of using AWS Lambdas as HTTP handlers.
