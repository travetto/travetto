# Terminal

## General terminal support

**Install: @travetto/terminal**
```bash
npm install @travetto/terminal

# or

yarn add @travetto/terminal
```

This module provides basic support for interacting with the terminal, and provides the basis for output colorization and the basic command line interactions.  The functionality can be broken down into:
   *  Terminal Interactions

## Terminal Interactions
Within the [Travetto](https://travetto.dev) framework, there are plenty of command line interactions that are enhanced with additional interactivity.  This mainly revolves around indicating progress while a program is executing.  The module provides support for:
   *  Progress Bars
   *  Waiting Indicators
   *  Streaming Content
This is generally meant for use within the framework, and so is highly tailored to the specific needs and scenarios.  You can see this pattern play out in the [Compiler](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/compiler#readme "The compiler infrastructure for the Travetto framework") progress output, or in [Pack](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/pack#readme "Code packing utilities")'s output. 

In these scenarios, the dynamic behaviors are dependent on having an interactive TTY.  When running without access to a proper stdin, the output will default to basic line printing.    This dynamic behavior can also be disabled using the environment variable `TRV_QUIET`.  When set to `1` will provide a minimal text-based experience.
