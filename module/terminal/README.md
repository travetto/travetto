# Terminal

## General terminal support

**Install: @travetto/terminal**
```bash
npm install @travetto/terminal

# or

yarn add @travetto/terminal

# or

pnpm add @travetto/terminal
```

This module provides basic support for interacting with the terminal, and provides the basis for output colorization and the basic command line interactions.  The functionality can be broken down into:
   *  Output Colorization
   *  Terminal Interactions

## Output Colorization
Oddly enough, colorizing output in a terminal is a fairly complex process.  The standards are somewhat inconsistent and detection can be a tricky process. For terminals, [Node](https://nodejs.org) supports 4 different levels of coloring:
   *  0 - One color, essentially uncolored output
   *  1 - Basic color support, 16 colors
   *  2 - Enhanced color support, 225 colors, providing a fair representation of most colors
   *  3 - True color, 24bit color with R, G, B each getting 8-bits.  Can represent any color needed

This module provides the ability to define color palettes using RGB colors, and additionally provides support for palettes based on a dark or light background for a given terminal.  Support for this is widespread, but when it fails, it will gracefully assume a dark background. 

These palettes then are usable at runtime, with the module determining light or dark palettes, as well as falling back to the closest color value based on what the existing terminal supports.  This means a color like 'olivegreen', will get the proper output in 24bit color support, a close approximation in enhanced color support, fall back to green in basic color support, and will be color less at level 0.

**Code: CLI Color Palette**
```typescript
import { StyleUtil } from '@travetto/terminal';

export const cliTpl = StyleUtil.getTemplate({
  input: '#6b8e23', // Olive drab
  output: '#ffc0cb', // Pink
  path: '#008080', // Teal
  success: '#00ff00', // Green
  failure: '#ff0000', // Red
  param: ['#ffff00', '#daa520'], // Yellow / Goldenrod
  type: '#00ffff', // Teal
  description: ['#e5e5e5', '#808080'], // White / Gray
  title: ['#ffffff', '#000000'], // Bright white / black
  identifier: '#1e90ff', // Dodger blue
  subtitle: ['#d3d3d3', '#a9a9a9'], // Light gray / Dark Gray
  subsubtitle: '#a9a9a9' // Dark gray
});
```

When the color palette is combined with [Runtime](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/runtime#readme "Runtime for travetto applications.")'s Util.makeTemplate, you produce a string template function that will automatically colorize:

**Code: Sample Template Usage**
```typescript
cliTpl`Build finished: status=${{success: "complete"}}, output=${{path: "/build.zip"}}`
```

This would then produce colorized output based on the palette, and the terminal capabilities. 

This module follows the pattern [Node](https://nodejs.org) follows with respect to the environment variables: `NO_COLOR`, `FORCE_COLOR` and `NODE_DISABLE_COLORS`

**Terminal: Node help on colors**
```bash
$ node -h | grep -i color

FORCE_COLOR                 when set to 'true', 1, 2, 3, or an
                            empty string causes NO_COLOR and
                            NODE_DISABLE_COLORS to be ignored.
NO_COLOR                    Alias for NODE_DISABLE_COLORS
NODE_DISABLE_COLORS         set to 1 to disable colors in the REPL
```

## Terminal Interactions
Within the [Travetto](https://travetto.dev) framework, there are plenty of command line interactions that are enhanced with additional interactivity.  This mainly revolves around indicating progress while a program is executing.  The module provides support for:
   *  Progress Bars
   *  Waiting Indicators
   *  Streaming Content

This is generally meant for use within the framework, and so is highly tailored to the specific needs and scenarios.  You can see this pattern play out in the [Compiler](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/compiler#readme "The compiler infrastructure for the Travetto framework") progress output, or in [Pack](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/pack#readme "Code packing utilities")'s output. 

In these scenarios, the dynamic behaviors are dependent on having an interactive TTY.  When running without access to a proper stdin, the output will default to basic line printing.    This dynamic behavior can also be disabled using the environment variable `TRV_QUIET`.  When set to `1` will provide a minimal text-based experience.
