# Asset Rest Support
## Provides integration between the travetto asset and rest module.

**Install: @travetto/asset-rest**
```bash
npm install @travetto/asset-rest
```

This module provides a clean and direct mechanism for processing uploads, built upon [busboy](https://github.com/mscdex/busboy). The module also provides some best practices with respect to temporary file deletion.

Once the files are uploaded, they are exposed on [RESTful API](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/1.0.0-dev/module/rest "Declarative api for RESTful APIs with support for the dependency injection module.")'s request object as `req.files`. The uploaded files are constructed as [Asset](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/1.0.0-dev/module/asset/src/types.ts#L5) instances, which allows for  integration with the [Asset](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/1.0.0-dev/module/asset "Modular library for storing and retrieving binary assets") module.

A simple example:

**Code: Rest controller with upload support**
```typescript
import { Controller, Post, Get } from '@travetto/rest';
import { Asset } from '@travetto/asset';

import { AssetRestUtil, Upload } from '@travetto/asset-rest';

@Controller('/simple')
export class Simple {

  @Get('/age')
  getAge() {
    return { age: 50 };
  }

  @Post('/age')
  getPage() {
    return { age: 20 };
  }

  /**
   * @param file A file to upload
   */
  @Post('/files')
  loadFiles(@Upload() file: Asset) {
    return AssetRestUtil.downloadable(file);
  }
}
```
