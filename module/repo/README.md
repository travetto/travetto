# Repo

## Monorepo utilities

**Install: @travetto/repo**
```bash
npm install @travetto/repo

# or

yarn add @travetto/repo
```

The repo module aims to provide some simple mono-repo based tools, primarily around module publishing.  The module provides two cli operations:

## CLI - Version
The versioning operation will find all the changed modules (and the modules that depend on the changed), and will update the versions in accordance with the user preferences.  The versioning logic is backed by [Npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)'s and [Yarn](https://yarnpg.com)'s versioning functionality and so it is identical to using the tool manually. The determination of what has or hasn't changed is relative to the last versioning commit.

**Terminal: Version execution**
```bash
$ trv repo:version

Please specify a level to continue

Usage: trv repo:version [options] <level> [prefix]

Options:
  -c, --no-changed  Disables: Only version changed modules
  -f, --force       Force operation, even in a dirty workspace
  -h, --help        display help for command
```

Level is a standard semver level of: major, minor, patch or prerelease.  The prefix argument only applies to the prerelease and allows for determining the prerelease level.  For example:

**Terminal: Cutting a release candidate**
```bash
npx trv repo:version prerelease rc
```

After a release is cut, a new commit will be created that marks the next stable point in the commit history.

**Code: Versioning Commit**

```

## CLI - Publish
The publish functionality is relatively naive, but consistent.  The code will look at all modules in the mono-repo and check the listed version against what is available in the npm registry.  If the local version is newer, it is a candidate for publishing.

**Terminal: Publish execution**
```bash
$ trv repo:publish -h

Usage:  repo:publish [options]

Options:
  -d, --no-dry-run  Disables: Dry Run?
  -h, --help        display help for command
```

By default the tool will execute a dry run only, and requires passing a flag to disable the dry run.

**Terminal: Publishing changes**
```bash
npx trv repo:publish -d
```

If no modules are currently changed, then the command will indicate there is no work to do, and exit gracefully.
