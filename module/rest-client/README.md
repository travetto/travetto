# RESTful Client Support

## RESTful support for generating clients for controller endpoints

**Install: @travetto/rest-client**
```bash
npm install @travetto/rest-client

# or

yarn add @travetto/rest-client
```

This module allows for a highly focused scenario, of producing [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org)-based clients for use within a homogenous ecosystem.  If a more general/robust solution is needed, [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/openapi#readme "OpenAPI integration support for the Travetto framework") operates with the the full generative abilities provided by [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)'s client generation tools. 

The primary benefit with this approach is faster code generation times, as well as no longer having a dependency on [docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) during generation.  This results in far less system resources, along with a more responsive rendering process.

**Code: Sample Configuration**
```yaml
---
rest.client:
  providers:
    - type: fetch
      output: api-client/sample
      moduleName: '@travetto-client/sample'
```

The code will only be generated during development (when `TRV_DYNAMIC` is true-ish).  This is the same pattern the [Data Modeling Support](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/model#readme "Datastore abstraction for core operations.")  and [RESTful API](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/rest#readme "Declarative api for RESTful APIs with support for the dependency injection module.") take for responding to code changes, in realtime. 

By default the output is relative to the workspace root, which is helpful when generated clients are centralized within a monorepo.  If the goal is to have the output relative to the module itself, then use `@#relative/path` as a convention.

## CLI - rest:client
The library, in addition to generating client output at runtime, also allows for direct generation of clients, regardless of any configurations defined in the application's configuration files.

**Terminal: Command Service**
```bash
$ trv rest:client --help

Usage: rest:client [options] <type:angular|config|fetch|fetch-node|fetch-web|rest-rpc> [output:string]

Options:
  -e, --env <string>     Application environment
  -m, --module <module>  Module to run for
  -h, --help             display help for command
```
