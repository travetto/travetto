This is a primary integration for the ${mod.AuthRest} module.  This is another level of scaffolding allowing for compatible authentication frameworks to integrate.  

Within the node ecosystem, the most prevalent auth framework is ${lib.Passport}.  With countless integrations, the desire to leverage as much of it as possible, is extremely high. To that end, this module provides support for ${lib.Passport} baked in. Registering and configuring a ${lib.Passport} strategy is fairly straightforward.

${d.Code('Sample Facebook/passport config', 'doc/conf.ts')}

As you can see, ${PassportAuthenticator} will take care of the majority of the work, and all that is required is:
${d.List(
  'Provide the name of the strategy (should be unique)',
  d`Provide the strategy instance. ${d.Note('you will need to provide the callback for the strategy to ensure you pass the external principal back into the framework')}`,
  'The conversion functions which defines the mapping between external and local identities.'
)}

After that, the provider is no different than any other, and can be used accordingly.  Additionally, because ${lib.Passport} runs first, in it's entirety, you can use the provider as you normally would any ${lib.Passport} middleware.

${d.Code('Sample routes using Facebook/passport provider', 'doc/simple.ts')}
