# Pack
## Code packing utilities

**Install: @travetto/pack**
```bash
npm install @travetto/pack
```

## CLI - pack 

**Terminal: Pack usage**
```bash
$ travetto travetto pack --help

Usage:  pack [options] [mode]

Options:
  -w --workspace [workspace]  Workspace directory (default: "/tmp/pack_travetto_pack")
  -h, --help                  display help for command
```

This command line operation will compile your project, and produce a ready to use workspace as a deliverable. The pack operation is actually a wrapper around multiple sub-operations that are run in series to produce the desired final structure for deployment.  The currently support operations are:

   
   *  assemble
   *  zip
   *  docker

### CLI - pack:assemble

Assemble is the operation that stages the project's code for deployment.  The assembly process goes through the following operations:

   
   1. Cleaning Workspace - Cleans workspace to start with an empty workspace
   1. Copying Dependencies - Computes the prod depedencies and copies them into the new workspace
   1. Copying App Content - Copies over application content (src/resources/support/bin)
   1. Excluding Pre-Compile Files - Any files that should be excluded pre-compilation, are removed
   1. Compiling - Compiles the code in the new workspace, isolating it from your local development
   1. Excluding Post-Compile Files - Removes any files that should be excluded, post compilation
   1. Copying Added Content - Adds in any additional content that is not in the standard locations
   1. Removing Empty Folders - Purge all empty folders, recursively
   1. Writng Env.js - Write out the .env.js file with computed any env vars that should be set for the deployed app
   1. Remove Source Maps - If keep source is false, all source maps are purged from your app's code
   1. Emptying .ts Files - If keep source is false, all .ts files are emptied, as compilation will not occur at runtime

**Code: Assemble Default Config**
```yaml
assemble:
  active: true
  cacheDir: cache
  keepSource: true
  readonly: true
  add:
    - node_modules/@travetto/cli/bin/travetto.js: node_modules/.bin/trv
    - node_modules/@travetto/cli/bin/travetto.js: node_modules/.bin/travetto
    - node_modules/lodash/lodash.min.js: node_modules/lodash/lodash.js
  excludeCompile:
    - node_modules/@travetto/*/alt/
    - node_modules/@travetto/*/test/
  exclude:
    - bower.json
    - LICENSE
    - LICENCE
    - '*.map'
    - '*.md'
    - '*.lock'
    - '*.html'
    - '*.mjs'
    - '*.ts'
    - '*.d.ts'
```

**Terminal: Assemble Usage**
```bash
$ travetto travetto pack:assemble --help

Usage:  pack:assemble [options] [mode]

Options:
  -w --workspace [workspace]  Workspace directory (default: "/tmp/pack_travetto_pack")
  -k --keep-source [boolean]  Should source be preserved (default: true)
  -r --readonly [boolean]     Build a readonly deployable (default: true)
  -h, --help                  display help for command
```

### CLI - pack:zip

Zip is an optional step, that can run post assembly.  The only configuration it currently provides is the ability to specify the output location for the zip file.

**Code: Zip Default Config**
```yaml
zip:
  active: false
  output: output.zip
```

**Terminal: Zip Usage**
```bash
$ travetto travetto pack:zip --help

Usage:  pack:zip [options] [mode]

Options:
  -w --workspace [workspace]  Workspace directory (default: "/tmp/pack_travetto_pack")
  -o --output [output]        Output File (default: "output.zip")
  -h, --help                  display help for command
```

### Modes
Various modules may provide customizations to the default `pack.config.yml` to allow for easy integration with the packing process.  A simple example of this is via the [RESTful API](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/master/module/rest#readme "Declarative api for RESTful APIs with support for the dependency injection module.") module, for how to publish lambda packages.

**Code: Rest, pack.lambda.yml**
```yaml
assemble:
  active: true
  keepSource: false
  add:
    - node_modules/@travetto/rest/support/aws-lambda.js: index.js
  env:
    NO_COLOR: 1
zip:
  active: true
  output: dist/lambda.zip
```

**Terminal: Invoking Pack with Mode**
```bash
npx travetto pack <mode>
```

### Configuration
By default the following paths are searched for configuration (in the following order):

   
   1. @travetto/pack/bin/pack.config.yml
   1. `<mode>` related pack.*.yml
   1. pack.config.ya?ml

Given the ordering, its clear to see that a project can define it's own configuration at the root of the project with `pack.config.yml`. Any defaults can be overidden.

**Code: Example pack.config.yml**
```yaml
workspace: dist/alt
assemble:
  active: true
  add:
    - assets: assets
    - /secret/location/key.pem: resources/key.pem
zip:
  active: true
  output: dist/build.zip
```
