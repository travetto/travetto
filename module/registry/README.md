# Registry
## Patterns and utilities for handling registration of metadata and functionality for run-time use

**Install: @travetto/registry**
```bash
npm install @travetto/registry
```

This module is the backbone for all "discovered" and "registered" behaviors within the framework. This is primarily used for building modules within the framework and not directly useful for application development.

## Flows
Registration, within the framework flows throw two main use cases:

### Initial Flows

The primary flow occurs on initialization of the application. At that point, the module will:

   
   1. Initialize [RootRegistry](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/registry/src/service/root.ts) and will automatically register/load all relevant files
   1. As files are imported, decorators within the files will record various metadata relevant to the respective registries
   1. When all files are processed, the [RootRegistry](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/registry/src/service/root.ts) is finished, and it will signal to anything waiting on registered data that its free to use it.

This flow ensures all files are loaded and processed before application starts. A sample registry could like:

**Code: Sample Registry**
```typescript
import { Class } from '@travetto/base';
import { MetadataRegistry } from '@travetto/registry';

interface Group {
  class: Class;
  name: string;
}

interface Child {
  name: string;
  method: Function;
}

export class SampleRegistry extends MetadataRegistry<Group, Child> {
  /**
   * Finalize class after all metadata is collected
   */
  onInstallFinalize<T>(cls: Class<T>): Group {
    return this.getOrCreatePending(cls) as Group;
  }

  /**
   * Create scaffolding on first encounter of a class
   */
  createPending(cls: Class): Partial<Group> {
    return {
      class: cls,
      name: cls.name
    };
  }
}
```

The registry is a [MetadataRegistry](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/registry/src/service/metadata.ts#L13) that similar to the [Schema](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/schema#readme "Data type registry for runtime validation, reflection and binding.")'s Schema registry and [Dependency Injection](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/di#readme "Dependency registration/management and injection support.")'s Dependency registry.

### Live Flow
At runtime, the registry is designed to listen for changes and to propagate the changes as necessary. In many cases the same file is handled by multiple registries.

As the [DynamicFileLoader](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/base/src/internal/file-loader.ts) notifies that a file has been changed, the [RootRegistry](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/registry/src/service/root.ts) will pick it up, and process it accordingly.

## Supporting Metadata

For the registries to work properly, metadata needs to be collected about files and classes to uniquely identify them, especially across file reloads for the live flow.  To achieve this, every `class` is decorated with additional fields.  The data that is added is:

   
   *  `‚≤êid` represents a computed id that is tied to the file/class combination;
