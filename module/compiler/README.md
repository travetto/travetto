# Compiler
## Node-integration of Typescript Compiler with advanced functionality for detecting changes in classes and methods.

**Install: @travetto/compiler**
```bash
npm install @travetto/compiler
```

This module expands upon [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org), with supplemental functionality:
   
   *  Read `tsconfig.json` from the project directory to provide 
   *  Supports on-the-fly compilation, nothing needs to be compiled ahead of time
   *  Enhanced AST transformations, and transformer registration [object Object]
   *  Intelligent caching of source files to minimize recompilation
   *  Support for detecting changes in sources files at runtime
   *  Allows for hot-reloading of classes during development    
      *  Utilizes `es2015` `Proxy`s to allow for swapping out implementation at runtime

Additionally, there is support for common AST transformations via [Transformation](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/master/module/transformer#readme "Functionality for AST transformations, with transformer registration, and general utils")

## Debugging

When dealing with transformers, logging is somewhat tricky as the compiler executes before the code is loaded.  To that end, the file `compiler.log` is created in the cache directory during the compilation process. This is a location that transformers should be free to log to, for debugging, and any additional feedback.

## CLI - compile 

**Terminal: Compiler usage**
```bash
$ travetto travetto compile --help

Usage:  compile [options]

Options:
  -c, --clean            Indicates if the cache dir should be cleaned
  -o, --output <output>  Output directory
  -q, --quiet            Quiet operation
  -h, --help             display help for command
```

This command line operation pre-compiles all of the application source code.  You can target the output location as well, which is useful in conjunction with `process.env.TRV_CACHE` for relocating the compiled files.

## CLI - pack 

**Terminal: Pack usage**
```bash
$ travetto travetto pack --help

Usage:  pack [options] [mode]

Options:
  -w --workspace [workspace]  Workspace directory (default: "dist/workspace")
  -k --keep-source [boolean]  Should source be preserved (default: true)
  -r --readonly [boolean]     Build a readonly deployable (default: true)
  -z --zip [boolean]          Zip the workspace into an output file (default:
                              false)
  -o --output [output]        Output location when zipping
  -h, --help                  display help for command
```

This command line operation will compile your project, and produce a ready to use workspace as a deliverable.  The output can be zipped on demand, or left as a folder structure for integration with other tools.  

### Configuration

By default packing follows a default pattern driven by a configuration structure:

**Code: Config Structure**
```typescript
type Flags = {
  keepSource?: boolean;
  readonly?: boolean;
  output?: string;
  zip?: boolean;
};

interface Config {
  delete?: {
    file?: Record<string, number>;
    folder?: Record<string, number>;
    ext?: Record<string, number>;
    module?: Record<string, number>;
  };
  copy?: {
    folder?: Record<string, string>;
    file?: Record<string, string | string[] | 0>;
  };
  env?: Record<string, string>;
  defaultFlags?: Flags;
}
```

A project can define it's own configuration at the root of the project with `pack.config.yml`. 

**Code: Example pack.config.yml**
```yaml
defualtFlags:
  workspace: dist/alt
  output: dist/build.zip
copy:
  folder:
    assets: assets
  file:
    /secret/location/key.pem: resources/key.pem
```

### Modes
Various modules may provide customizations to the default `pack.config.yml` to allow for easy integration with the packing process.  A simple example of this is via the [RESTful API](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/master/module/rest#readme "Declarative api for RESTful APIs with support for the dependency injection module.") module, for how to publish lambda packages.

**Terminal: Invoking Pack with Mode**
```bash
npx travetto pack <mode>
```
