This module expands upon <a target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://typescriptlang.org">Typescript</a>, with supplemental functionality:
<ul> <li>Read <code class="item path">tsconfig.json</code> from the project directory to provide </li>
 <li>Supports on-the-fly compilation, nothing needs to be compiled ahead of time</li>
 <li>Enhanced AST transformations, and transformer registration [object Object]</li>
 <li>Intelligent caching of source files to minimize recompilation</li>
 <li>Support for detecting changes in sources files at runtime</li>
 <li>Allows for hot-reloading of classes during development <ul> <li>Utilizes <code class="item input">es2015</code> <code class="item class">Proxy</code>s to allow for swapping out implementation at runtime</li></ul></li></ul>
Additionally, there is support for common AST transformations via <a class="module-link" href="https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/transformer" title="Functionality for AST transformations, with transformer registration, and general utils">Transformation</a>
<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
When dealing with transformers, logging is somewhat tricky as the compiler executes before the code is loaded.  To that end, the file <code class="item path">compiler.log</code> is created in the cache directory during the compilation process. This is a location that transformers should be free to log to, for debugging, and any additional feedback.

<h2 id="cli">CLI</h2>

The module provides the ability to clear the compilation cache to handle any inconsistencies that may arise.

TODO: Describe cli behavior
