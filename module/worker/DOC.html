This module provides the necessary primitives for handling dependent workers.  A worker can be an individual actor or could be a pool of workers. Node provides ipc (inter-process communication) functionality out of the box. This module builds upon that by providing enhanced event management, richer process management, as well as constructs for orchestrating a conversation between two processes.
<h2 id="execution-pools">Execution Pools</h2>

With respect to managing multiple executions, <a target="_blank" class="source-link" href="https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/worker/src/pool.ts#L34">WorkPool</a> is provided to allow for concurrent operation, and processing of jobs concurrently.  To manage the flow of jobs, <a target="_blank" class="source-link" href="https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/runtime/src/queue.ts#L4">AsyncQueue</a> is used to support a wide range of use cases. <a target="_blank" class="source-link" href="https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/runtime/src/queue.ts#L4">AsyncQueue</a> allows for manual control of iteration, which is useful for event driven work loads. <br><br>

<h2 id="ipc-support">IPC Support</h2>

To handle communication between processes, <a target="_blank" class="source-link" href="https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/worker/src/ipc.ts#L9">IpcChannel</a> is provided. This class abstracts the underlying IPC mechanism and provides a simple interface for sending and receiving messages. It also includes event management capabilities, allowing for easy handling of different message types. By default the class assumes it is running in a child process, but it can also be used in a parent process (by passing in the child process) to communicate with child processes.
