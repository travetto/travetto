# Worker

## Process management utilities, with a focus on inter-process communication

**Install: @travetto/worker**
```bash
npm install @travetto/worker

# or

yarn add @travetto/worker
```

This module provides the necessary primitives for handling dependent workers.  A worker can be an individual actor or could be a pool of workers. Node provides ipc (inter-process communication) functionality out of the box. This module builds upon that by providing enhanced event management, richer process management, as well as constructs for orchestrating a conversation between two processes.

## Execution Pools
With respect to managing multiple executions, [WorkPool](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/worker/src/pool.ts#L32) is provided to allow for concurrent operation, and processing of jobs concurrently.  To manage the flow of jobs, [AsyncQueue](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/runtime/src/queue.ts#L6) is used to support a wide range of use cases. [AsyncQueue](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/runtime/src/queue.ts#L6) allows for manual control of iteration, which is useful for event driven work loads. 

## IPC Support
Within the `comm` package, there is support for two primary communication elements: [ChildCommChannel](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/worker/src/comm/child.ts#L6) and [ParentCommChannel](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/worker/src/comm/parent.ts#L10).  Usually [ParentCommChannel](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/worker/src/comm/parent.ts#L10) indicates it is the owner of the sub process. [ChildCommChannel](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/worker/src/comm/child.ts#L6) indicates that it has been created/spawned/forked by the parent and will communicate back to it's parent. This generally means that a [ParentCommChannel](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/worker/src/comm/parent.ts#L10) can be destroyed (i.e. killing the subprocess) where a [ChildCommChannel](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/worker/src/comm/child.ts#L6) can only exit the process, but the channel cannot be destroyed.
