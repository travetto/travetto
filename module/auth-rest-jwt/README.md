# Rest Auth JWT
## Rest authentication JWT integration support for the travetto framework

**Install: @travetto/auth-rest-jwt**
```bash
npm install @travetto/auth-rest-jwt
```

The [JWTPrincipalEncoder](https://github.com/travetto/travetto/tree/main/module/auth-rest-jwt/src/principal-encoder.ts#L28) is exposed as a tool for allowing for converting an authenticated principal into a JWT, and back again.  This token does not own a session, but allows for encoding the auth state into JWT constructs.
