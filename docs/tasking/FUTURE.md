Future Ideas
========================
- Electron basis (maybe)

- WebSockets / Server Sent Events
  - Observables in Angular?

- Firebase? for data model <!-- Tried already, and failed horribly, Firestore doesn't support pagination or sorting without a lot of work -->

Tooling
--------------------------
  - [ ] VSCode Plugin
    - [ ] Hit Swagger Endpoint from list, maybe swagger against self
