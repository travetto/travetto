=====================================

* VSCode, setup IPC as a server, and remove custom events from the compiler
* Move to ESM-First
  - Wait for module reloading
* ES Decorators
  - Wait for parameter decorators
  - Wait for function decorators
      - Injectable Factories
      - One-off routes
* Contemplate relationship between base/registry
  - Does registry become app base?
  - Does base become util?

* Per-file transformer set?, allow for manifest to color which transformers apply
* Shared generated types, and naming collisions
  - Revisit how we name autogenerated files (e.g. rest-client)
