Active Development (3.5.0 - RC)
=====================================

* Move to ESM-First
  - Wait for module reloading
* ES Decorators
  - Wait for parameter decorators
  - Wait for function decorators
      - Injectable Factories
      - One-off routes
* Contemplate relationship between base/registry
  - Does registry become app base?
  - Does base become util?

* Per-file transformer set?, allow for manifest to color which transformers apply
* Shared generated types, and naming collisions
  - Revisit how we name autogenerated files (e.g. rest-client)

* Pack and mono-repo + shared resources/config 
  - Need a way to pack in common resources if necessary?
  - May need to combine config files potentially

* Omit/Pick as type shapes for schema validation
