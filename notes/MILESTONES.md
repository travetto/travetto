------------------------------------------------------
Release 1.0.0: 2020-07-04 -- Launch
------------------------------------------------------
### Breaking Changes
* *Provider / *Store classes have been renamed to *Source .  This to make the  sub-module model consistently named (Cache, Identity, Model)
* The AssetStore methods have been renamed to match the cache model, since they are basically the same thing
* Image manipulation is a new package and is no longer tied to the asset service
* The Email service has been simplified to only support mustache.
* The Email template service has been overhauled.  It is now a template compiler and there are command line tools to compile (watch and compile), and to the UI for development has been overhauled‚Äù
* Exec and Schedule  module have been removed
* The docker portion of Exec has been moved to the Command module
* The program execution part of Exec has been integrated into the boot module
* The Worker module has been simplified, and is only one worker input source now, (though others can be added)
* The Test  module now boasts a watchable test server, that will listen for changes in test files and automatically re-run them.  This is what is used to power the new plugin implementation.
* All ENV variables have been renamed from X to TRV_X  except for DEBUG, TRACE, and NODE_ENV
* The app module no longer supports isolated sub-apps, everything is always connected.
* The compiler  now knows about interfaces
* The compiler now is also able to infer return types, and so they should no longer be needed for DI and type checking
* Schema now supports simple types/interfaces for field definitions (also useful for SchemaQuery)
* The auto flag has been removed from the schema package
* Extensions files are now part of the barrel export, and will complain if used without the appropriate import.  E.g. import {SchemaQuery} from '@travetto/schema';
* The app cache is now located within the app directory as .trv_cache . Since the command line test run pre-compiles the tests, they use the same cache as well.
* Code transformation has been externalized to it's own module.

### Major Fixes
* Updated to Node v12 and Typescript 3.9.x as a minimum requirement
* 

------------------------------------------------------
Release 1.1.0: 2020-09-20 -- Incremental Improvements
------------------------------------------------------
### Major changes

* @travetto/cache now supports DynamoDB as a valid storage model
* @travetto/rest-fastify properly supports running a lambda context using the aws-lambda-fastify module.  

### Minor changes
* Moved typescript to require 4.0.0 or higher.

### Breaking changes
* @travetto/app has disconnected itself from the rest module and is now a standalone service, when desiring to run the application via the app module.
* @travetto/email-template now uses .email.html as the template suffix.
* @travetto/email-template the email dev UI has been removed.

------------------------------------------------------
Release 2.0.0: 2021-02-01 -- Model Rewrite
------------------------------------------------------

### Major and Breaking Changes 

#### Schema Overhaul

Schema has taken a role as the gatekeeper of all inbound data into the application. Now `application`, `config` and `rest` utilize the schema 
transformations and validations for entry points.  This enables consistent use of schema type information, validators, in all of these modules. 
This also means the error messaging is consistent and behaves  the same way across all of these modules.  

#### Model Overhaul
* Asset now relies on Models with Streaming support
* Cache now relies on Models with Expiry support
* Auth-Model relies on Models alone
* S3, Firebase, Redis, Dynamo were all added as standard model providers
* All model implementations now have extension testing for the services that they are compatible with
* `asset-mongo`, and `asset-s3` are gone, and relies on a `model` provider that has streaming
* `cache/src/extension/{redis,dynamodb}` are gone and are also now model provided
* `model` is gone and has been replaced by `model-core` and `model-query`.
* `model-core` is a series of interfaces/contracts, and some minor utility functions. All ownership has been pushed to the various providers.
* Method names have been standardized as `verbNoun` e.g. `getStream` or `deleteExpired`

#### Auth Overhaul
* Greatly simplified number of interfaces/classes to understand
* Identity has been folded into principal, and is now the standard bearer for a known user
* Request object has been reduced in complexity, and AuthContext is gone.
* Session has been reworked to be the counterpart to the JWT for encoding a principal to the user

#### Rest Internals Overhaul
* Testing support greatly increased, and provides clearer behavior for testing as a server, and as a lambda.
* Streamlined internals, and separated lambda from general usage

#### Support for Dynamic Module references, specifically, third party
* No longer symlinking for local dev
* Allows for better testing of extensions
* Moved the source code indexing into boot to be used by the CLI
   * All support/* files are converted to .ts
   * Indexing only looks for typescript files
   * Will speedup tools that rely upon full file system scanning

#### Extension Overhaul (and testing thereof overhaul)
* Extensions are now tested in isolation allowing for various combinations of extensions to be tested
* Relies on use of Dynamic Modules to allow for creating a custom cache related to the modules being loaded

#### Logging overhaul (Base no longer duplicates functionality of log)
* All filtering and formatting now belong to the log module
* All log statements are encouraged to following the pattern of `message`, `{ payload }`
* Startup logs may still need some support if the goal is suppression

#### Module reorg
* `auth-passport` is gone, and is now an extension of `auth-rest`.
* `auth-model` is gone, and is now an extension of `auth`.
* `asset-*` for implementations, are now model modules
* `cache`'s built in extensions have been removed.  `model` with expiry support is all that is needed now.
* Extensions have been moved to the module which owns the complexity (e.,g. schema rest support dealt more with the internals of rest than schema, and has been moved).
#### Typescript Upgrade
* Shifted codebase away from use of `any` to `unknown` where applicable (over 750 instances migrated)
* Migrated all `private var` usages to `#var`, and aligning with class initialization changes.
* Moving to typescript 4.3
* Converted all available files to `.ts`, only build scripts remain in `.js`

#### Dependency Injection Enhancements
* Using more interfaces where possible (and less reliance on abstract classes)
   * This allows for better control at the cost of potentially duplicated functionality
* Support for injecting/registering by interfaces
* Better default behavior on multiple providers, with local code breaking ties.

#### Removed `sync` versions of `ResourceManager` methods
* All resource lookups are considered to be `async`, as runtime support for `sync` was an anti-pattern

#### Separated out configuration of which folders to scan during execution (and allowing for soft optional)
* This has the affect of removing a bunch of custom logic around tests
* Alt folders have been removed, and can be emulated by specifying `TRV_SRC_LOCAL` values as needed.

#### Compiler Ownership
* Reworked @travetto/boot compiler to create clear responsibility for managing the compiler/transpiler relationship with node runtime.
* Modified @travetto/compiler to no longer register extension directly, but extend functionality defined in boot 

#### Entrypoint Standardization
* Allow for use of `main` functions to allow for direct invocation of any file, primarily used for plugins and cli activities
* Removed all `plugin-*.js` files as in lieu of exposing a `main` function in the target files.
* Removed almost all `*.js` files in the test folders, in lieu of exposing `main` functions. Tests no longer auto execute on import.

#### Generator Simplification
* Moved away from using yeoman due to dependency bloat, and went with a simple `@travetto/cli` based solution. Can be invoked with `npx @travetto/scaffold`

#### Local Dev Overhaul
* Now relies on environment variables (`direnv` makes it easier) for augmenting what would have been embedded in the framework.
* Using tsconfig paths in lieu of symlinks, general development performance, and refactoring are substantially improved.
* Removed dependency on symlinks

### Non-Breaking Changes

#### Standard dependency upgrades

#### Lessened dependency on bash scripts, and moved build processes over to @arcsine/nodesh
* Local development should now support windows, but there may still be a few edge cases

#### Docs have been converted back to typescript, and the doc folders have been simplified
* Proper typechecking on all docs
* Renamed file from DOCS.js to doc.ts
* Moved main README.md to `related/overview/doc.ts`

### Lerna Removal
* Removed usage of lerna within framework, handling mono repo tasks manually
* Reduced hoisted node_module size by 40%

------------------------------------------------------
Release 2.2.0: 2022-07-25 -- Alignment
------------------------------------------------------
As the framework has been moving forward, there has been a drive and goal to align with the growing standards in the TS/JS community. The last version (2.1.0) and the current release, have been about removing technical debt, and aligning with the changing landscape. In this release, the fundamental shift has been towards: 

* Removing exceptions to Typescript strict mode, and relying on strict mode as the standard 
* Explicit typing of every method, which has had the side effect of changing some return types slightly. 
* Stricter linting rules to help enforce better practices (e.g. treating type casts as an anti-pattern) 
* Swapping out use of NodeJS.ReadableStream for stream.Readable. 
* Various dependency updates 
## Rest Body Parsing
Centralized rest body parsing to common, controlled code to help create a consistent experience.  Each framework is still responsible for compressing as the nuances of sending seem to be highly specific to each framework.

## Future Work
* ESM Support - Many dependencies are starting to move to ESM and this is starting to cause problems.  As soon as the loader proposal for ESM is finalized, this will be the next major release item.
* TC39 Decorators - The new decorator proposal hit Stage 3, and so this will point to a rewrite of all decorators within the framework, w/o any API changes.  This will have a dependency on Typescript moving in the right direction, but this looks to be a priority for TS4.9.  
* Heap Snap-shotting - A mechanism for bootstrapping startup overhead.  This would provide a boost to testing startup time, and allow for simplification of "unloading" code, that is primarily used for testing. 

------------------------------------------------------
Release 3.0.0: 2022-09-01 -- Future facing
------------------------------------------------------

## Major/Breaking Changes

### The /extension/ pattern is removed
All "extension" points have been moved to their own modules, removing support for @file-if and @line-if directives.  These patterns were convenient, but led to more complexity around determining what was in use and what wasn't.  Now package.json is definitive, and it is clear what files/dependencies are needed or not.

### Transpilation/Loading Overhaul
One of the primary goals here is to end up with a `.trv_cache` folder that is directly invokable without compilation. The ideal here is the previous work around a "readonly" mode is replaced in a world where there is only javascript files.  This provides an increased level of security while setting the stage for integrating with existing js bundlers.  This will have ramifications in the pack extension.

### JSX Support

### Docs to JSX

### ESM Support

### Filesystem access 
- Manifest

### Logging Overhaul

### Config Overhaul

### Resources Overhaul

### VS Code extension overhaul

### New Modules (or old but new)
* Auth-model - Holds model for auth persistence with the model framework
* Auth-rest-jwt - Support for auth-rest and jwt tokens
* Auth-rest-session - Support for auth-rest and session integration
* Auth-rest-context - Support for exposing the auth user into the request context support
* Auth-passport - Clear support for passport, and handles pulling the correct dependencies
* Email-nodemailer - Clear support for nodemailer, and handles pulling the correct dependencies
* Rest-aws-lambda - Extracted all aws lambda code and dependencies, and can be pulled in as needed
* Rest-express-lambda - rest-express + rest-aws-lambda + necessary deps
* Rest-koa-lambda - rest-koa + rest-aws-lambda + necessary deps
* Rest-fastify-lambda - rest-fastify + rest-aws-lambda + necessary deps
* Schema-faker - Clear support for faker, and handles pulling the correct dependencies

### Rest Interceptors
Standardizing rest interceptor patterns for enabling/disabling and ability to provide route specific overrides.

### Rest + Context
The Rest framework now treats context as a given, and can be disabled as needed.

### Typescript 4.9+
The shift to 4.9+ brought some unexpected changes that required rewriting how decorators are managed within the framework.  This also bit the eslint team.  Additionally "refinement" on comparing literal objects is now an error which broke some testing patterns.  There had always been a fallback, so no change was needed, but is pointing to providing a clearer pattern of how to use.

### Pack Overhaul
* Now integrates with rollup for producing a tree-shaken singular output file
